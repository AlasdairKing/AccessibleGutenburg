# AccessibleGutenburg
An ebook reader for screenreader users, written in VB6, that pulls books from the Gutenberg website. 

The UI is built with large text and designed to be trivial to navigate using almost exclusivly cursor keys and return. This is to make it super-accessible for screenreader users - blind and visually-impaired users. 

However, it screen-scrapes the Gutenberg site to deliver the books, and as of Feb 2019 it doesn't work! So I guess they amended their website, and I would need to update it to fix it.
